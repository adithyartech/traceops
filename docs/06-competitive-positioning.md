# Competitive Positioning

## Category
TraceOps is an "Enterprise Incident Intelligence Platform" focused on:
- automated RCA
- evidence packaging
- NOC workflows

## Why we win
- Evidence-first output (trust)
- Explainable decisions
- Correlation engine (not only protocol decoding)
- Works across vendors and environments (on-prem friendly)

## What TraceOps is NOT
- not just a packet tool
- not just an alert dashboard
- not a vendor-locked AI assistant

## Wedge strategy
Start with PCAP-driven RCA automation (Phase 2 sellable),
then expand into unified telemetry fabric and autonomous actions (Phase 3-5).
