# TraceOps Vision

## One-line
TraceOps is an evidence-driven RCA platform that turns network and infrastructure telemetry into actionable incident findings, timelines, and root cause reports.

## What problem are we solving?
Enterprises face outages daily, but root cause analysis is:
- slow
- manual
- dependent on senior engineers
- inconsistent (no standard incident pack)

Packet captures, logs, metrics, flow records, and configs exist — but they are siloed.

## What TraceOps becomes
TraceOps becomes the "NOC Brain":
- Detects symptoms
- Correlates signals across layers
- Generates an explainable RCA
- Suggests next actions / playbooks
- Packages evidence into ticket-ready incident reports

## Core principle
**Evidence first. AI second.**

AI is allowed only to:
- summarize
- explain
- guide next steps

AI is NOT allowed to invent any claim without evidence.

## Long-term product goal
Build an Autonomous NOC platform that can:
- auto collect evidence based on triggers
- run investigations
- reduce MTTR drastically
- minimize human L1/L2 workload
